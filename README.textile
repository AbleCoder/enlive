h1. The new Enlive

Enlive is a selector-based (Ã  la CSS) templating library for Clojure. 

An Enlive template has two parts: a HTML file and a @deftemplate@ form
somewhere in a clj file.

h2. What's new in the new Enlive?

Transformations (the right-hand parts of rules) are now plain old closures. These functions take one arg (the selected node) and return nil, another node or an arbitrarily nested collection of nodes.

Rules are applied top-down: the first rule transforms the whole tree and the resulting tree is passed to the next rules.

Nodes are transformed deep-first, that is: if a selector selects several nodes, descendants are transformed first. Hence, when the transformation is applied to an ancestor, you can "see" the transformed descendants.

  A    if A and B are selected and transformed by T the the resulting tree is (T A      )
